<h1>Hi üëãüèΩ ! I'm a Full Stack Developer and aspiring Founder.</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I had been in Fine Jewellery and Manufacturing for 3 years. I knew the trade inside and out, all whilst being based in Hatton Garden, the UK capital for Handcrafted Fine Jewellery. I could sell, negotiate, navigate and communicate with every type of person. 

But, I got the itch to study again and left that great career to do a 4 Year Bachelors Degree in International Business - I just graduated 1st Class, with Honours! During one of arguably the most challenging study periods ever - I'm super proud of that! Also, whilst studying full-time through the pandemic, I also worked full-time in Barclays doing Financial Analysis - pretty hard to juggle both, but I managed!

After obtaining my 1st class in International Business, I started a job search, and within a week and a half I was lucky enough to land my first proper grad role at EmpowerRD - I am very lucky, that in this economic climate I got it so quick. I got the progressional opportunities, along with the freedom to grow alongside the organization.

I've since left EmpowerRD to join a Software Development Course, with one of the most established Bootcamps in the industry called Le Wagon, I started on the 11th of Jan 2022, and for those 10 weeks - I have changed careers into a Full Stack Developer, with the aim to develop and validate my own ideas which I hope to turn in to a business and follow my passion which is Entrepreneurship!

Oh, I also speak native English and Italian.

Now, let's see where life takes me!</p>
